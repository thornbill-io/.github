## Thornbill
[Thornbill](https://thornbill.io/) is the simple, unbiased way for Australians to validate their energy bills, manage their usage, and ensure every month that they're on the best pricing. We're launching soon.

### What's Broken?
- **Inaccurate Billing:** Research shows that 1 in 10 energy bills are inaccurate. Confusing language and price inconsistencies mean that you pay for retailer mistakes.
- **Choice Overload:** Right now, there are over 17,000 energy offers for Australian households and small businesses. Governments and retailers haven't done enough to cut through the noise and help consumers find cheaper prices.
- **Lost Data:** When you switch retailers, your insights into energy usage and spend are lost. Consumers currently have to choose between keeping their data or cutting their spend.
- **Broker Incentives:** Typical energy comparison companies are paid by select retailers to switch you to a deal that pays them a commission. To them, you're the product, not the customer.

### Our Solutions
- **Instant Analysis:** Thornbill analyses your bill and alerts you to over-charging, errors, and contract adherence. You find out in seconds exactly what issues to raise with your retailer.
- **Market Evaluation:** Every bill is checked against every available market offer for your meter, based on your usage and rates. As the market changes, you can have confidence knowing that you're on the most competitive pricing.
- **Data Continuity:** Keep all of your usage and spend information in the one place, regardless of who bills you. Get long-term insights that aren't lost when you switch retailer.
- **Retailer Agnostic:** We aren't paid by the retailers - ever. Because we compare the entire market, you can select the best offer for your home or business - and confidently ignore the telemarketers and brokers.
